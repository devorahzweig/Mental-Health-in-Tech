Correlation between age and mental health consequence - The hypothesis is that ageing increases mental health issues in tech.   We wished to examine how age affects mental illness. Step one was to split data in three age categories - Young (20-32), Middle (33-43), and Senior (44-55). Analysis shows the direct effect of age on mental health . We can conclude that additional 5% of tech professionals admitting mental health issues as age goes + 10 years. 
Correlation between gender and mental health consequence - Analysis shows that gender is correlated with the prevalence of mental disorders in tech. Women are more likely to admit mental health issues - only 28.35% of women had no mental health consequence; for men - 41.85% had no mental health issues
Correlation between benefits and mental health consequence - The hypothesis is that company health benefits lower mental health issues in tech. Data analysis show insignificant difference of tech professionals who have no mental health issues between companies that offer benefits and companies that do not - 36.46% vs 37.74%. Percentage of tech specialists who confirmed mental health consequence is lower in companies that offer benefits and/or unsure (donâ€™t know) comparing to companies who do not offer benefits - 21.4% and 18.67% vs 28.93%.

Determining the Correlation Between Company Size and Mental Health Consequence: 

The hypothesis is that the larger the company size, the greater the chance of suffering mental health consequences. To prove this, we split the data by company sizes ranging from tiny, (6-25 employees), small, (26-100 employees), medium, (100-500 employees), to large, (>1000 employees). After this, it was further reduced by mental health condition. After creating pie charts to determine the percentages of critical mental health consequences for each company size, it was determined that large companies had the greatest percentage of critical mental health consequences, at 28.7%. Therefore, the correlation between company size and mental health is a strong, positive correlation. As company size increases, so does the possibility of suffering from a mental health condition. 

Determining the Correlation Between Coworker Relationships and Mental Health Consequence:

The hypothesis is that the stronger the coworker relationships are, the less likely one is to suffer from mental health issues. The data was reduced by whether or not an employee felt comfortable opening up to their colleagues, and if they also suffered mental health consequences. After creating additional pie charts, it was found that only 4.9% of people who had strong colleague relationships reported having mental health issues, while 53.5% of people who did not have strong colleague issues reported mental health issues. The correlation, therefore, between having a close colleague relationship and mental health issues is a strong negative one.

Choosing Between a Large or Small Company: 

Following the analysis of the 2014 dataset, one can find themselves facing an important question: "Would it be better for my mental health to work in a small company or a large one?"
While the studies shown above have proved that an employee in a larger firm is more susceptible to suffer from mental health issues, the difference in the consequences between tiny and large companies is only 9.7%. However, large companies allow one to develop close relationships with coworkers. The difference in consequences between close and nonexistent relationships is 48.6%. After observing these statistics, one may find that a larger company will provide more benefits towards the mental health of its employees.
